## Examples

Add dependencies directly from Git while the ecosystem matures:

```toml
[dependencies]
gpui = { git = "https://github.com/zed-industries/zed", branch = "main" }
gpui-component = { git = "https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component.git" }
```

Rust code example:

```rust
use gpui::prelude::*;
use gpui_component::DatePicker;

fn main() {
    // Initialize GPUI app and open a window...
    DatePicker::new()
        .locale("en-US")
        .on_select(|date| println!("Selected: {:?}", date));
}
```
